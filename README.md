# Malware-feed

This project scans a predefined set of Git repositories for new releases.
If new releases are found, the assets will be hashed.
If an asset is compressed or part of an archive, it will be first extracted/uncompressed before hashing it.

The tracked repositories are configured in the local [Config File](./config.ini) with the following convention:
- the repositories are split into sections, which specify the `category` of the malware group.
- every row in a section is a key-value pair of a new tracked repo, where the key is the canonical `name` and the value is the URL to the repository.

Repositories will be checked daily for updates using a [GitHub action](.github/workflows/update_feed.yml).
